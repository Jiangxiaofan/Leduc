# Leduc

leduc is a simple poker game with only 6 cards, which serves as a common benchmark in poker AI.

The game is first presented in paper:https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1207/1207.1411.pdf

In Leduc hold â€™em, the deck consists of two suits with three cards in each suit. There are two rounds. In the first round a single private card is dealt to each player. In the second round a single board card is revealed. There is a two-bet maximum, with raise amounts of 2 and 4 in the first and second round, respectively. Both players start the first round with 1 already in the pot.

Due to the simplified structure, there are lots of strong benchmark algorithms which approach Nash Equilibrium.
